# Parcube

Hi,

Here a platormer game for speedrun.
The game is on Linux and you need pygame for now and Windows.

### Linux:
1. Download the source
2. Install pygame :
  * for Arch: yaourt -S python-pygame
  * for Debian/Ubuntu : sudo apt-get install python-pygame
To launch the game, use ./start.py

### Windows:
1. Download and extract the zip: https://mega.nz/#!vVRn3Zra!yzbGPgjjIBI-_yKsmHzRx49EIr2ynWbAoOP-Ezxz1-g
2. Launch start.exe

### The game:
You are a cube and you need to reach the end the most rapidly possible if you can.
You have 3 abilities in total : go to left, go to right, jump; but you have only 2 of these abilities at one time.
At the start, you play with left arrow and right arrow. When you reach a burgandy zone, your 2 new keys are shown on the screen.

Good luck, have fun !
