Hi,

Here a platormer game for speedrun.
The game is only on Linux for now and you need pygame. To launch the game, use ./start.py

You are a cube and you need to reach the end the most rapidly possible if you can.
You have 3 abilities in total : go to left, go to right, jump; but you have only 2 of these abilities at one time.
At the start, you play with left arrow and right arrow. When you reach a burgandy zone, your 2 new keys are shown on the screen.

Good luck, have fun !
