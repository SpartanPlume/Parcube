Hi,

Here a platormer game for speedrun.
The game is on Linux and you need pygame for now and Windows.

Linux:
Download the source and install pygame:
-for Arch: yaourt -S python-pygame
-for Debian/Ubuntu : sudo apt-get install python-pygame
To launch the game, use ./start.py

Windows:
Download and extract the zip: https://mega.nz/#!yFgCXJyZ!0oZEJ99UjZcF6PiVZS6QrzjuotUgZDSd28dwYljmdSY
Launch start.exe

You are a cube and you need to reach the end the most rapidly possible if you can.
You have 3 abilities in total : go to left, go to right, jump; but you have only 2 of these abilities at one time.
At the start, you play with left arrow and right arrow. When you reach a burgandy zone, your 2 new keys are shown on the screen.

Good luck, have fun !
